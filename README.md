## Core Business Questions
1. How do total sales and order volumes trend over time?
2. Which product categories and products generate the highest revenue?
3. What is the average order value, and how does it vary by category?
4. What proportion of orders are completed, pending, or cancelled?
5. How much revenue is impacted by cancelled orders?
6. Which payment methods are most commonly used, and do they relate to order outcomes?
7. Which customer locations contribute the most to overall sales?

## Key Metrics (Planned)
- Total Sales
- Total Orders
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Sales by Category
- Sales by Location
- Order Status Distribution (Completed / Pending / Cancelled)
- Revenue Lost Due to Cancelled Orders
- Payment Method Usage

## Scope & Limitations
- The analysis focuses on descriptive and diagnostic insights rather than sales forecasting.
- Profit and cost data are not available; therefore, analysis is limited to revenue-based metrics.
- The dataset contains a limited number of transactions and may not represent full-scale enterprise operations.

Work in progress.
